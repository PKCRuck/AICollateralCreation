Indoor Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) Access Point

Benefits
COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION FOR SMALL FACILITIES
The R350e Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) access point (AP) is a cost
effective solution that can deliver fast and reliable Wi-Fi
services to up to 128 client devices.
INDUSTRY LEADING WI-FI PERFORMANCE
Patented RUCKUS technologies for performance
optimization and interference mitigation delivers
superior user experience.
MESH NETWORKING
Dynamically create self-forming, self-healing network
mesh with RUCKUS patented SmartMesh technology
reducing expensive cabling, and complex configurations
by checking a box.
MULTIPLE UNIFIED MANAGEMENT OPTIONS
Manage the R350e from the cloud, with on-premises
physical/virtual appliances, or without a controller.
KEEP EXISTING SWITCHES AND CABLES
Designed to operate on existing PoE switches and CAT 5e
cabling to minimize costly power infrastructure
upgrades.

Small facilities can face big-time demands on their wireless infrastructure.
Whether staying overnight in a motel, working out of a small office or connecting
to a public hotspot, users are often still accessing the same high-bandwidth
applications and content they’d consume anywhere else. And they expect
reliable connectivity. How can you provide it at a price even the smallest business
can afford?
The RUCKUS® R350e delivers consistent, reliable Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) wireless networking at an
affordable price. The AP features several patented RUCKUS technologies for performance
optimization and interference mitigation found in our premier access points, delivering superior user
experiences. But it provides them in an ultra-compact form factor built for small venues—with a
price tag to match.
The R350e is an ideal choice for low-density environments will less coverage areas including small
and medium-size economy hotels and motels, small and medium-size businesses, retail locations,
restaurants, and multi-tenant small offices and branch offices.
The R350e Wi-Fi 6 AP incorporates patented technologies found only in the RUCKUS Wi-Fi portfolio.
·

Improve throughput with ChannelFly®, which dynamically finds less congested Wi-Fi channels to
use.

·

Supports up to 128 clients and 8 SSIDs per AP.

The R350e provides an ideal combination of features and performance for smaller environments at
a price any business can afford.
