General Description
XGIGA 100G QSFP28 LR4 optical Transceiver integrates receiver and transmitter path on one module.
In the transmit side, four lanes of serial data streams are recovered, retimed, and passed to four laser drivers.
The laser drivers control 4-Distributed Feedback Laser (DFB) with center wavelength of 1296 nm, 1300nm,
1305nm and 1309 nm. The optical signals are multiplexed to a single-mode fiber through an industry
standard LC connector. In the receive side, the four lanes of optical data streams are optically de-multiplexed
by the integrated optical de-multiplexer. Each data stream is recovered by a PIN photo-detector and transimpedance amplifier, retimed. This module features a hot-pluggable electrical interface, low power
consumption and 2-wire serial interface
The product is designed with form factor, optical/electrical connection and digital diagnostic interface
according to the QSFP28 Multi-Source Agreement (MSA) and compliant to IEEE 802.3ba.

Notes:

1.

GND is the symbol for signal and supply (power) common for QSFP28 modules. All are common

within the QSFP28 module and all module voltages are referenced to this potential unless otherwise noted.
Connect these directly to the host board signal common ground plane.
2.

VccRx, Vcc1 and VccTx are the receiving and transmission power suppliers and shall be applied

concurrently. Recommended host board power supply filtering is shown below. Vcc Rx, Vcc1 and Vcc Tx
may be internally connected within the QSFP28 transceiver module in any combination. The connector pins
are each rated for a maximum current of 500mA.

VI.

Digital Diagnostic Functions

XGIGA QXP29B4-10D-V4-L support the 2-wire serial communication protocol as defined in the QSFP28
MSA. Which allows real-time access to the following operating parameters:


Transceiver temperature



Laser bias current



Transmitted optical power



Received optical power



Transceiver supply voltage

It also provides a sophisticated system of alarm and warning flags, which may be used to alert end-users
when particular operating parameters are outside of a factory-set normal range.
The operating and diagnostics information is monitored and reported by a Digital Diagnostics Transceiver
Controller inside the transceiver, which is accessed through the 2-wire serial interface. When the serial
XGIGA Communication Technology Co.,ltd

www.amphenol-cs.com/optics.html
Rev 1.0
protocol is activated, the serial clock signal (SCL pin) is generated by the host. The positive edge clocks
data into the QSFP28 transceiver into those segments of its memory map that are not write-protected. The
negative edge clocks data from the QSFP28 transceiver. The serial data signal (SDA pin) is bi-directional
for serial data transfer. The host uses SDA in conjunction with SCL to mark the start and end of serial
protocol activation. The memories are organized as a series of 8-bit data words that can be addressed
individually or sequentially. The 2-wire serial interface provides sequential or random access to the 8 bit
parameters, addressed from 00h to the maximum address of the memory.
This clause defines the Memory Map for QSFP28 transceiver used for serial ID, digital monitoring and
certain control functions. The interface is mandatory for all QSFP28 devices. The memory map has been
changed in order to accommodate 4 optical channels and limit the required memory space. The structure of
the memory is shown in Figure 2 -QSFP28 Memory Map. The memory space is arranged into a lower, single
page, address space of 128 bytes and multiple upper address space pages. This structure permits timely
access to addresses in the lower page, e.g. Interrupt Flags and Monitors. Less time critical entries, e.g. serial
ID information and threshold settings, are available with the Page Select function. The structure also
provides address expansion by adding additional upper pages as needed. Upper page 01 allows
implementation of Application Select Table, and upper page 02 provides user read/write space. The lower
page and upper pages 00 and 03 are always implemented. The interface address used is A0xh and is mainly
used for time critical data like interrupt handling in order to enable a “one-time-read” for all data related to
an interrupt situation. After an Interrupt, IntL, has been asserted, the host can read out the flag field to
determine the effected channel and type of flag.
For more detailed information including memory map definitions, please see the QSFP28 MSA
Specification.
