RUCKUS® Cloudpath® Enrollment System
Secure network access for BYOD, guest users and
IT-owned devices

RUCKUS® Cloudpath® Enrollment System is a cloud service (or onpremises software) that delivers secure network access for any user, and
any device, on any network.
Cloudpath secures every connection with WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise, protecting data in transit
between the device and the access point with powerful encryption. You gain visibility
and control over which devices are on the network, and can define and manage policies

so every user sees only the network resources they should see. The Cloudpath service
checks the security posture of devices during onboarding to ensure they comply with your
organization’s security policies. The system redirects users with noncompliant devices to
remediate them before granting access. It associates every device with a user, and you can

easily revoke access at any time—for example, when a BYOD user leaves the organization.
The service supports any Wi-Fi enabled device, including headless and IoT devices.
Intuitive self-service workflows streamline network onboarding—users gain network access
simply and securely without IT intervention. The service lets you deliver a great onboarding
experience while dramatically reducing helpdesk tickets related to network access. Internal
users can easily self-provision any device for network access using their existing login
credentials. Cloudpath installs a digital certificate for network authentication so that,
after the initial connection, users don’t need to re-enter credentials when they connect
again. Guest users access a self-service login portal and receive credentials in the form of
a CommScope-patented Dynamic PSK™ via email or SMS. Dynamic PSKs remove the need
to install a certificate on the device, and offer similar security benefits. They are intuitive
for users and much more secure than conventional PSKs because every user/device gets a
unique key.
