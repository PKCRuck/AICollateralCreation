RUCKUS® Fiber Backpack

Fiber Backpack For H510

Benefits
·

Provides fiber backhaul option for the
H510 access point (AP).

·

Converts the 10/100/1000Mbps
ethernet from the AP to fiber via an SFP
cage.

·

Supports both PON and Active Fiber SFP
modules

·

Provides power supply to AP by
converting DC input power to PoE out.

·

Installs unnoticeably with H510 AP.

In the hospitality segment today, fiber-based deployments require an
Optical Network Terminal (ONT) to connect access points (APs),
deployed in hotel room, to fiber media. Most ONTs today don't
support active and passive types of fiber SFP modules. In addition,
installing an ONT along with an AP leads to wire clutter and other
challenges, which can impact room aesthetics.
RUCKUS Fiber Backpack is an optional, field installable, Fiber-toEthernet Media Converter accessory providing customers a fiber
Optic Network Terminal (ONT) backhaul interface for H510 Wall-plate
AP, our leading hospitality AP.
RUCKUS Fiber Backpack simplifies Wi-Fi deployments for fiber-ready
hotels/ MDU. The custom designed fiber backpack attaches
unnoticeably to the H510. It supports both PON and Active Fiber SFP
modules. It also provides power over PoE to the attached H510 AP.
