RUCKUS® R670
Indoor Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be) Access Point with 9.34 Gbps Data Rate

Bandwidth-hungry ultra-high definition video, virtual reality, Internet of Things (IoT), an explosion
of new devices and content. With these kinds of demands, organizations in every industry need
more from their Wi-Fi. But with hundreds of devices and nonstop wireless noise and interference,
busy indoor spaces can make challenging wireless environments.

Benefits

The dawn of the Wi-Fi 7 era ushers in a new wave of possibilities. With its groundbreaking
advancements in speed, capacity, latency, and reliability, Wi-Fi 7 will transform the way we
we connect and interact with the digital world.

Connect more devices simultaneously
Improve device performance, by enabling more
simultaneous device connections with built-in 6 spatial
streams (2x2:2 in 2.4GHz, 2x2:2 in 5GHz, 2x2:2 in 6GHz)
technology. 9.34 Gbps Combined data rate.

From seamless streaming of ultra-high-definition content to immersive virtual and augmented
reality experiences, Wi-Fi 7 enables applications that were previously unimaginable. Real-time
social gaming can reach new heights, allowing for lag-free, competitive multiplayer experiences
with unparalleled responsiveness.

Wi-Fi 7 for mainstream deployment
Provides exceptional end-user experience expanding
the range of use cases for Wi-Fi 7 including guest rooms,
classrooms, meeting rooms.
BeamFlex+ Adaptive Antenna Technology
For greater speed, fewer errors, and instant bandwidth
delivery, RUCKUS BeamFlex+ patented technology offers
first-of-its-kind smart antenna technology that
maximizes signal coverage, throughput, and network
capacity and work with any client. It further increases
MIMO diversity gain and maximizes spatial multiplexing
potential.

The Internet of Things (IoT) also receive a significant boost, as Wi-Fi 7 supports a massive
number of connected devices simultaneously, facilitating smart homes, smart cities, and
intelligent automation on a grand scale.
Moreover, industries such as hospitality and education can benefit immensely from Wi-Fi 7 low
latency and high reliability. Other verticals like, MDUs, large public venues and service
providers gain greatly from Wi-Fi 7 unprecedented advancements in speed and capacity.
The RUCKUS R670 is a mid-range Wi-Fi 7, tri-band concurrent indoor AP that delivers 6 spatial
streams (2x2:2 in 2.4GHz, 5GHz and 6GHz or 2x2:2 in 2.4GHz and 4x4:4 in 5GHz in dual band mode)
With Multi-Link-Operation (MLO), Preamble Puncturing, 4K QAM Modulation and 320MHz channels.
It delivers industry-leading performance environments with a combined data rate of 9.34 Gbps.
F. urthermore, a 5 Gbps Ethernet port eliminates wired backhaul bottleneck for full use of available
Wi-Fi capacity.

Converged Access Point
Allows customers to eliminate siloed networks and
unify Wi-Fi and non Wi-Fi wireless technologies into
one single network by using built-in BLE or Zigbee
with support for Matter and Thread*. Expandable to
future wireless technologies through USB port.

Wireless requirements within enterprises are expanding beyond Wi-Fi. The R670 has one built-in
IoT radio offering onboard BLE or Zigbee capabilities. The R670 is a converged access point
that allows customers to seamlessly integrate any new wireless technologies with the USB port.

5 GbE eliminates bottleneck
Optimized multi-gigabit Wi-Fi performance delivered
using the built-in 1/2.5/5GbE port to connect to
multi-gigabit switches.

The R670 expands the reach of Wi-Fi 7 and addresses the needs of every day deployments,
in guest rooms, classrooms, hotel rooms and lobby. It supports data intensive streaming
applications like 4K/8K video transmissions, while supporting latency sensitive voice and data
applications with stringent quality-of-service requirements.

Multiple management options
Manage the R670 with on premise physical/ virtual
appliances and control auto-provisioning for faster
deployment and seamless firmware upgrades.
Enhanced Security
The latest Wi-Fi security standard with WPA3 and receive
enhanced protection from man-in-the-middle attacks.
Adds the power of RUCKUS DPSK3 to WPA3/SAE
combining enhanced security with the flexibility and
ease of use of dynamic passphrase to secure network
access.
More Than Wi-Fi
Support solutions beyond Wi-Fi with RUCKUS IoT Suite,
RUCKUS AI, RUCKUS One, RUCKUS Cloudpath
Enrollment System and onboarding software

The R670, with built-in RUCKUS exclusive technology, dramatically improves network performance
through a combination of patented wireless innovations and learning algorithms that includes:
·

Airtime Decongestion: Increases average network throughput in heavily congested environments

·

Transient Client management: Reduces interference traffic from unconnected Wi-Fi devices

·

BeamFlex®+ Adaptive Antennas: Extended coverage range and optimized throughput with
patented dynamic multi-directional antennas and radio patterns and work with any client.

Whether you are deploying ten or ten thousand APs, the R670 is also easy to manage through
RUCKUS multiple management options including cloud based and on premises controllers.

Access Point BeamFlex Antenna Pattern

Figure 1. Example of BeamFlex+ pattern

RUCKUS’ BeamFlex+ adaptive antennas allow the R670 AP to dynamically choose among a host of
antenna patterns (over 4,000 possible combinations) in real-time to establish the best possible
connection with every device. This leads to:
·

Better Wi-Fi coverage

·

Reduced RF interference

Traditional omni-directional antennas, found in generic access points, oversaturate the environment
by needlessly radiating RF signals in all directions. In contrast, the RUCKUS BeamFlex+ adaptive
antenna directs the radio signals per-device on a packet by-packet basis to optimize Wi-Fi coverage
and capacity in real-time to support high device density environments. BeamFlex+ operates without
the need for device feedback and hence can benefit even devices using legacy standards.
